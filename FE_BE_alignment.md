**Review and Recommendations:**

After reviewing both the backend and frontend README.md files, I have identified areas where adjustments can be made on the frontend to align with the backend APIs. Additionally, I have noted where additional backend endpoints or fields are required to support the frontend functionality.

---

## Adjustments to Frontend to Align with Backend

### 1. Endpoint Paths and Naming Conventions

- **Singular vs. Plural Endpoints:**
  - **Backend:** Uses singular nouns in endpoints (e.g., `/job/{id}`, `/application/{id}`).
  - **Frontend:** Uses plural nouns in endpoints (e.g., `/jobs/{id}`, `/applications/{id}`).
  - **Action:** Adjust frontend API calls to use singular endpoints to match the backend.

### 2. Authentication Endpoints

- **Login Endpoint:**

  - **Backend:** Expects `email` and `password` in the request body.
  - **Frontend:** Currently uses `username` instead of `email`.
  - **Action:** Update the frontend to use `email` in both the login and registration forms.

- **Registration Endpoint:**
  - **Backend:** Expects `email`, `password`, and `name`.
  - **Frontend:** Sends `username`, `password`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `role`.
  - **Action:**
    - Change `username` to `email`.
    - Combine `firstName` and `lastName` into a single `fullName` field, or clarify with the backend if they can accept separate fields.
    - Remove `role` from the registration request, as the backend does not support setting the role during registration.

### 3. User Profile Fields

- **GET `/users/{id}` and PUT `/users/{id}` Endpoints:**
  - **Backend Response Fields:**
    - `id`, `fullName`, `email`, `address`, `phone`, `resume`, `department`, `role`
  - **Frontend Expected Fields:**
    - `id`, `username` (email), `firstName`, `lastName`, `yearsOfExperience`, `skills`, `motivationLetter`
  - **Action:**
    - Adjust frontend to use `fullName` instead of `firstName` and `lastName`, or request backend to accept separate `firstName` and `lastName` fields.
    - Map `resume` to include `yearsOfExperience`, `skills`, and `motivationLetter` if appropriate.
    - Use `email` instead of `username`.
    - Update the frontend to match the backend's available fields or coordinate with the backend to include the additional fields.

### 4. Job Posting Fields

- **Job Fields Mapping:**
  - **Backend Fields:**
    - `userId`, `department`, `listingTitle`, `dateListed`, `dateClosed`, `jobTitle`, `jobDescription`, `additionalInformation`, `listingStatus`, `experienceLevel`, `modelResume`, `modelCoverLetter`
  - **Frontend Fields:**
    - `title`, `location`, `fullDescription`, `requirements`, `benefits`, `applicationDeadline`
  - **Action:**
    - Map frontend fields to backend fields:
      - `title` ↔ `listingTitle` or `jobTitle`
      - `fullDescription` ↔ `jobDescription`
      - `applicationDeadline` ↔ `dateClosed`
      - `requirements` and `benefits` may need to be included in `additionalInformation` or request the backend to add these fields.
    - Adjust frontend code to use the backend's field names or coordinate with the backend to accept the frontend's field names.

### 5. Application Submission

- **POST `/application` Endpoint:**
  - **Backend Expected Fields:**
    - `id`, `userId`, `jobId`, `dateApplied`, `coverLetter`, `customResume`, `applicationStatus`
  - **Frontend Submission Fields:**
    - `jobId`, `coverLetter`
  - **Action:**
    - Clarify with the backend whether `id`, `userId`, and `dateApplied` are required in the request body or if they can be auto-generated.
    - Adjust frontend to include `customResume` if necessary.
    - Ensure `applicationStatus` is set appropriately (e.g., defaulted to "applied" on submission).

### 6. Adjusting Endpoint URLs

- **Endpoint Consistency:**
  - Ensure that all frontend API calls match the backend's endpoint URLs exactly, including the use of singular nouns and any required path parameters.

## Additional Backend Endpoints and Fields Required

To fully support the frontend functionality, the following additional backend endpoints and fields are required:

### 1. User Management Endpoints (Admin Functionality)

- **GET `/users`**

  - **Purpose:** Allows the admin to retrieve a list of all users.
  - **Required For:** Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`), User Management.
  - **Note:** Should be restricted to admin users via authorization.

- **DELETE `/users/{id}`**
  - **Purpose:** Allows the admin to delete a user.
  - **Required For:** Admin functionality to manage users.

### 2. Hiring Manager Management Endpoints

- **POST `/hiring-managers`**

  - **Purpose:** Create a new hiring manager.
  - **Required For:** Admin functionality to add new hiring managers.
  - **Details:** Accepts hiring manager details like `email`, `password`, `fullName`, `department`.

- **GET `/hiring-managers`**

  - **Purpose:** Retrieve all hiring managers.
  - **Required For:** Admin Dashboard to display and manage hiring managers.

- **PUT `/hiring-managers/{id}`**

  - **Purpose:** Update hiring manager details.
  - **Required For:** Admin functionality to edit hiring manager information.

- **DELETE `/hiring-managers/{id}`**
  - **Purpose:** Delete a hiring manager.
  - **Required For:** Admin functionality to remove hiring managers.

### 3. Job Transfer Endpoint

- **PUT `/jobs/{id}/transfer`**
  - **Purpose:** Transfer job ownership to another hiring manager.
  - **Required For:** Admin functionality to reassign jobs.

### 4. Applications Endpoint for Current User

- **GET `/applications`**
  - **Purpose:** Retrieve all applications for the authenticated user.
  - **Required For:** Applicant Dashboard (`/applications`) to display user's applications.

### 5. Job Listings Endpoint

- **GET `/jobs`**
  - **Purpose:** Retrieve all job postings with optional filtering (e.g., search, pagination).
  - **Required For:** Job Listing Page (`/jobs`).
  - **Note:** The backend currently only provides a filtered job retrieval via `/job/{id}/filter={filter}`, which may not be sufficient.

### 6. Application Statistics Endpoint

- **GET `/applicants/{id}/statistics`**
  - **Purpose:** Retrieve application statistics for a specific applicant.
  - **Required For:** Hiring Manager Dashboard to view applicant statistics.

### 7. Application Filtering and Sorting

- **Enhancement to GET `/job/{id}/applications`**
  - **Purpose:** Allow filtering and sorting of applications by status, date, etc.
  - **Required For:** Hiring Manager's view to manage applications effectively.

### 8. Additional User Profile Fields

- **Fields to be Added:**
  - `yearsOfExperience`
  - `skills` (array)
  - `motivationLetter`

- **Required For:** Applicant Profile Page (`/profile`), Application Submission.

### 9. Partial Updates for PUT Requests

- **Clarification Needed on PUT Endpoints:**
  - Whether the backend supports partial updates (PATCH-like behavior) or requires the entire object.
  - **Affected Endpoints:**
    - PUT `/users/{id}`
    - PUT `/application/{id}`
    - PUT `/job/{id}`
  - **Required For:** Efficient frontend updates without needing to send unchanged data.

### 10. Error Handling and Response Codes

- **Standardized Error Responses:**
  - **Purpose:** To allow the frontend to handle errors gracefully and display appropriate messages.
  - **Required For:** Frontend error handling mechanisms.
  - **Details:** Provide consistent error codes and messages for common error scenarios (e.g., authentication failures, validation errors).

## Questions and Clarifications for Backend Team
